## Project Structure

```
Fake-news-detection/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore            # Git ignore file
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shanmukha8/Fake-news-detection.git
   cd Fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - If not, manually navigate to the URL shown in the terminal

3. **Analyze news articles**
   - Paste or type a news article in the text area
   - Click "Analyze Article" button
   - View the prediction (Real/Fake) with confidence score
   - Check additional metrics and recommendations

## How It Works

1. **Text Input**: User enters or pastes a news article
2. **Preprocessing**: Text is prepared for the model (tokenization, truncation)
3. **Model Inference**: Pre-trained RoBERTa model analyzes the text
4. **Classification**: Model outputs prediction (Real/Fake) with confidence score
5. **Display Results**: User-friendly visualization of results with metrics

## Model Information

- **Model**: `hamzab/roberta-fake-news-classification`
- **Base Architecture**: RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)
- **Task**: Binary Text Classification
- **Input**: Text (max 512 tokens)
- **Output**: Label (Real/Fake) + Confidence Score

### Example Usage:
1. **Real News Detection**
   - Input: Legitimate news article
   - Output: "REAL NEWS" with confidence score

2. **Fake News Detection**
   - Input: Suspicious or fabricated article
   - Output: "FAKE NEWS" with confidence score

## Limitations & Disclaimer

- Model accuracy depends on training data quality
- May not detect all types of misinformation
- Should be used as a supplementary tool, not the sole source of verification
- Always cross-check information from multiple reliable sources
- The model is trained on specific datasets and may have biases

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for multiple languages
- [ ] Implement source credibility checking
- [ ] Add fact-checking API integration
- [ ] Include historical analysis of articles
- [ ] Deploy to cloud platform (Heroku/AWS)
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple articles
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanism
- [ ] Add visual analytics dashboard

## Deployment

### Deploy on Streamlit Cloud (Free)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Sign in with GitHub
4. Click "New app" and select your repository
5. Set main file path as `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy"

### Local Deployment

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
```

## Dependencies

- `streamlit`: Web application framework
- `transformers`: HuggingFace Transformers library
- `torch`: PyTorch deep learning framework

## Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues
If the model fails to download:
```bash
# Manually download the model
python -c "from transformers import pipeline; pipeline('text-classification', model='hamzab/roberta-fake-news-classification')"
```

### Memory Issues
If you encounter memory errors:
- Reduce the input text length
